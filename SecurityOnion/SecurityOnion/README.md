# ðŸ§… Security Onion SOC Lab

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience setting up and using **Security Onion** as a SOC (Security Operations Center) platform. I installed it in VirtualBox, configured the environment, generated alerts using `so-test`, and investigated suspicious traffic.

- Example: `ET MALWARE Zbot Generic URI/Header Struct .bin`.  
- I reviewed the IP (`188.72.243.72`), ASN (Webzilla B.V.), and geolocation (Netherlands).  
- **Skills:** Alert investigation, threat intelligence basics.
